                    In supervised learning, you train your model on a labelled dataset that means we have both raw input data as well as its results. We split our data into a training dataset and test dataset where the training dataset is used to train our network whereas the test dataset acts as new data for predicting results or to see the accuracy of our model.

                <h2>Unsupervised</h2>
                <p>
                    In unsupervised learning, the information used to train is neither classified nor labelled in the dataset. Unsupervised learning studies on how systems can infer a function to describe a hidden structure from unlabelled data. The main task of unsupervised learning is to find patterns in the data.

                <p>
                    It is a Machine Learning algorithm that allows software agents and machines to automatically determine the ideal behaviour within a specific context to maximize its performance. It does not have labelled dataset or results associated with data so the only way to perform a given task is to learn from experience.
